## 💼 Internship Experience

### **RedWall Taihe Private Fund — Quantitative Research Intern**  
**Mar.2025 – Aug.2025 · Shanghai, China**  

- Improved key components of a live-trading limit-up strategy, including stock selection universe, intraday order-placement signals, exit rules, and queuing algorithms, resulting in notable annualized performance gains and successful live deployment.  
- Independently designed and implemented the order-placement logic for the strategy, including stock screening, order/cancellation signals, and exit mechanism. Developed a capital-constrained backtesting framework to validate strategy effectiveness.

### **Heze Hedge Fund — Quantitative Research Intern**  
**Jun.2024 – Nov.2024 · Shanghai, China**

- Reproduced and innovated alpha factors from brokerage research reports using daily data, Level-2 market data, minute-level data, and tick data; conducted factor selection, backtesting, and factor library maintenance.  
- Analyzed Level-2-based daily limit-up features and performed grouped return studies. Optimized screening-rule parameters via **Optuna** (Sharpe ratio maximization) and applied **Genetic Programming** to discover feature combinations.  
- Built market-status evaluation indicators and analyzed investment performance under different market regimes to enhance timing strategies.  
- Researched multi-day K-line pattern–based stock-selection strategies; used tick data to determine execution ordering and applied Optuna to optimize coefficients, opening conditions, and position sizing.

### **Fanatics — E-Commerce Operations Intern**  
**Jun.2023 – Aug.2023 · Shanghai, China**

- Processed and analyzed sales data using Excel to identify performance drivers and support strategic decision-making.  
- Assisted in planning sales strategies including pricing, promotional campaigns, and performance targets.


## 📊 Research Projects

### **High-Dimensional Precision Matrix Estimation (Python)**  
**Nov.2023 – May.2024 · Project Leader**

- Reproduced a penalized quadratic-loss ADMM algorithm in Python to improve computational efficiency and benchmarked performance against the R implementation.  
- Explored the use of GPU-accelerated third-party Python libraries to improve scalability for high-dimensional precision matrix estimation.

### **Market Group Dynamics Coordination Mechanism of Brand Prototype Formation**  
**Mar.2023 – Apr.2024 · Project Leader**

- Developed a multivariate attitude-change model using stochastic evolution partial differential equations to characterize randomness in attitude changes and the evolution of internal system structures.  
- Conducted numerical integration and Python-based simulations to analyze dynamic characteristics and statistical distributions.  
- Led the team in producing a research paper; the project was awarded **Outstanding Project (Top 10%)** in the SJTU Undergraduate Research Program.


### **Multivariate Analysis and Predictive Modeling on Wine Dataset**  
**May.2023 – Jun.2023 · Project Leader**

- Performed outlier detection and exploratory data visualization. Applied Best Subset Selection, Ridge Regression, LASSO, and Principal Component Regression to identify key predictors.  
- Conducted clustering analysis and compared model performance using K-fold Cross-Validation and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation.  
- Built regression models (e.g., Decision Tree Regression) and classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) to predict wine quality. Evaluated group differences using t-tests and ANOVA.
